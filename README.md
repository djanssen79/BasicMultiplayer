# BasicMultiplayer
A JMonkeyEngine template to show how simple multiplayer games can be done easily

The project was made with the fantastic JMonkeyEngine. It shows a very basic example of how to make a multiplayer game. The project can be extended easily, as it only deals with the minimum requirements.

Note, this is a simple template project. It does not deal with lag compensation, nor does it deal with other advanced stuff. But, it is a starting point for a nice game e.g. within a LAN network - and basically for educational purpose.
